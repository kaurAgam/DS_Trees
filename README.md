## Binary Search Trees (BST) in C++

This repository provides a collection of Binary Search Tree implementations in C++. Binary Search Trees are widely used data structures that provide efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

### Introduction
A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree data structure where each node has a key and two children: left and right. The key in the left child is less than the key in the parent node, and the key in the right child is greater than or equal to the key in the parent node. This property enables efficient search, insert, and delete operations.

This repository provides well-documented and optimized implementations of Binary Search Trees in C++ to serve as a reference for understanding and working with this data structure.

### Features
- Insertion of new elements while maintaining the binary search tree property
- Searching for a specific element efficiently
- Deletion of elements while preserving the binary search tree structure
- Height calculations of the tree
- Min and Max elements in BST
